# GreenBelt-Monitoring-System

### Project Overview
The **Green Belt Monitoring System** is an IoT-based solution designed to help industries monitor and maintain their green belt areas in compliance with environmental regulations. 

### Project Details
This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller, connected to various sensors (such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and PIR sensors), and a water pump. The system collects real-time data on environmental conditions and displays it in the Blynk mobile application, where it also sends notifications to alert users about necessary actions like watering the plants or detecting unusual activity.

### Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of environmental factors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture).
- Automated irrigation control through a water pump based on soil moisture levels.
- Motion detection using PIR sensors.
- Mobile app integration with Blynk for live data display and alert notifications.

### Benefits
By automating and monitoring the green belt, this system ensures that industrial areas contribute positively to environmental sustainability by maintaining plant health, conserving resources through efficient water use, and helping regulatory agencies verify compliance effortlessly.
